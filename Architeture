#Architecture Flow

IAM → Security Groups → RDS → EC2 → App → ALB → AMI → ASG → S3 → CloudWatch → Testing



**IAM — IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT**

- All tasks were performed using an IAM user instead of the root account, following the principle of least privilege, Root Account Used Only Once.
- No credentials hard-coded in servers or code.
